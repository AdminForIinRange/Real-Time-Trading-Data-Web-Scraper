# Real-Time Trading Data Web Scraper

This project focused on improving backend development skills by creating a real-time trading data web scraper. Through this project, I learned how to utilize Puppeteer to scrape webpages and emit the data to the client-side using Socket.io, eliminating the need for a RESTful API. Additionally, I refined my Node.js and Express skills. The project was built with React, Puppeteer, Express, Socket.io, and Animate.css.
